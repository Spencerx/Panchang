		 ~~~~~~ Installation Instruction ~~~~~~~

The installation procedure depends on the base operating system:-

Linux(Fedora, CentOS, RHEL) System
==================================

If you have AMP stack (apache, mysql, php) running on your system then follow
the following steps:-

1) Create a directory named "calendar" inside the apache root directory.
2) Copy the content of "src" directory to newly created directory "calendar".
3) Run the script mysql_schema.sh to create the required database schema. 
	$ ./mysql_schema.sh

Else if you want to install this package from scratch on fresh operating system
then start installing with these steps:-

1) Run the script install.sh which will install and configure the AMP server then
   install this package on proper position.
	$ ./install_Linux.sh
2) Run the script mysql_schema.sh to create the required database schema.
	$ ./mysql_schema.sh


Mac OSX
=======	

Mac OSX already comes with Apache installed and PHP bundled up with it. By default 
both are inactive and require us to get them ready for business. This can be achieved
by following simple steps:
	
1) Run the script install_Mac.sh which will set up the Apache server with PHP support.
	$ ./install_Mac.sh

2) Create a directory named "calendar" inside the apache root directory.
	
3) Copy the content of "src" directory to newly created directory "calendar".

4) Download the MySQL package for Mac OSX depending on the base machine from-
	http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.1.html#macosx-dmg

5) Install everything in the package in this order: mysql, the startup item, the 
   preference pane. Run this command 
	export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin/

6) Run the script mysql_schema.sh to create the required database schema.
	$ ./mysql_schema.sh
